# Create Design and Plan

I will proceed as a product and tech expert using Context7 whenever I need to look up info about api and packages.

For the change request: $ARGUMENTS or whatever change request is in docs/feedback if $ARGUMENTS not provided

As the Tech Lead (following .kiro/steering/tech.md):
1. Use Context7 to research relevant APIs and libraries
2. Create a software design document in docs/development/
3. Include technical analysis, architecture, API design, and testing strategy

As both Product Manager and Tech Lead:
4. Create an implementation plan in docs/planning/
5. Break down into specific, testable tasks
6. Include acceptance criteria and performance requirements
7. Prioritize tasks based on dependencies

The plan will be the primary guide for implementation.
