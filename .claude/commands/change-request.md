# Create Change Request

I will proceed as a product and tech expert using Context7 whenever I need to look up info about api and packages.

As the Product Manager (following .kiro/steering/product.md), I will:

1. Analyze the change request: $ARGUMENTS
2. Evaluate user impact and strategic alignment
3. Ask user any clarifying questions if needed
4. Create a formal change request document in docs/feedback/
5. Use the Change Request Analysis template from product.md

The document will include:
- User problem description
- Proposed solution
- User impact analysis
- Implementation considerations
- Recommendation with rationale
