# Implement Plan

I will proceed as a product and tech expert using Context7 whenever I need to look up info about api and packages.

As the Tech Lead (following .kiro/steering/tech.md), I will:

1. Locate and read the plan in docs/planning/ for: $ARGUMENTS or for the plan is in docs/planning if $ARGUMENTS not provided
2. Review progress and find where I left off
3. Use Context7 for any API/library documentation needed
4. Use Web Search for implementation difficulties
5. Implement the next task/sub-task
6. Write tests for each major task
7. Ensure tests pass before moving to next task
8. Check off completed tasks in the plan
9. Follow Apple HIG for all UI decisions

I will continue until the current work session is complete or the plan is finished.
