description: Analyze current features and architecture

# Baseline Understanding

I will analyze the current state of the MDBrowser project:

1. Review current features from docs/requirements/current-features.md
2. Analyze current architecture from docs/development/current-architecture.md
3. Analyze change request document in docs/feedback if it exists
4. Summarize key components and capabilities
5. Identify areas relevant to upcoming changes

This provides context for making informed decisions about new features and changes.
